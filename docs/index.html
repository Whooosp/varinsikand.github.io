      <h2>Hello and welcome to my page! </h2>
      <p> I didn't know much of HTML and CSS before this, but there’s never a better time to learn, so here we are. I absolutely love to learn and make new things, and web/software development is the next frontier that I’ve recently begun to tackle. At my school I get many privileges including exclusive honors CS classes as part of being in the Computing Honors Scholars society here at UTD, and I take great pride in my ability to dissect and work through problems. Having said this, school simply doesn’t teach important development skills that would allow me to make something that impacts people.</p>
      <p> And so, I began to make efforts to develop the skills to make things that I previously only ever had plans for. It began with acquiring more languages (something I continue to work on to this day) and then branching into my first ever major project: an auto-scheduler. This project was something I had dreamed of since high school, since the concept of making someone’s life easier through something I made was and is my primary driving force when it comes to development. I gathered a small team of fellow CS students at UTD and got to work as lead developer, finishing the smart scheduling functions last summer.</p>
      <p> Admittedly, while the app’s functions are robust and something I am quite proud of, I had no clue how to develop the UI and even less of an idea of how a project timeline should be structured. I hope to gain this sort of project-based knowledge through my internship.</p>
      <p> Aside from my autoscheduler, I have done multiple smaller-scale projects. While my app reflects the reason why I code (to make smart products that automate people’s lives), my impromptu projects display my ability to learn. My position at ACM Research was the result of me learning Python in little more than a day to make a program that creates circular genome maps based off of genetic data, and I’m currently in the process of learning how to make a full MERN stack webpage as part of my role in the robotics nonprofit Ev3Everywhere.  </p>
      <p> I take great pride in my accomplishments, but I am far more interested in being able to learn new ways to make a difference in other people’s lives. I know that whatever knowledge I gain from working in a team such as Lob, with values so like my own, will prove to be invaluable as I push ahead in my goal to create awesome software that people are thankful to have. I’m incredibly excited to be applying and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
